# Zadaca-br.6_8085

From gated port to address OAh per interrupt sequence reads a string of an unknown number of characters but no greater than 128. The beginning of the sequence is indicated by the code AAh, a end with code 55h. Within the range it can appear data with value AAh. Place on top of the steak the largest and smallest data of the array. If they are more than 128 data occur, the ÂµP operation stops.

Microcomputer's systems

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

- [Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8086 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using EMU8086:

1. Download and install Emu8086 from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open Emu8086 and load the `palindrome.asm` file.
4. Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5. Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
